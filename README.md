## Goal
In the project, I fetch a dataset from Kaggle, named "COVID -19 Coronavirus Pandemic Dataset"(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-dataset), and develop a samll bash scripts to do some data processing operations on it.

The small apllication supports two kinds of operations based on the user input in the command line.
1. Show contries name 
2. Sort the data by the total cases column and print out top 30 countries name

To run the app, simply run command:
          bash run.sh
